## Grindstone is for you.

Grindstone is made to be whatever you want it to be. It's free, and open-source. It's built from the ground-up with plugins in mind, so you can make the application you have, but bring in the functionality you need easily. We're planning on building our games on top of it, generalizing our tools and systems to be used by all as we build them.
