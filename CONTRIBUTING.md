## Issues
If you're having an issue, please report it - that's still a contribution! Simply put up an issue with the following fields:

* If your issue happens when working on your own code, please attach a minimal verifiable example for us to try to replicate your issue.

## Contributing Code.
To contribute code, please create a pull request with the purpose of your changes, a summary, and potential issues if any. If you're solving an issue, be sure to link that issue. Remember to fully test your code to the best of your ability.

Ensure your code is either 100% your own, or compatible with the MIT License. If it requires an attached License, do so and make that clear in your Pull Request.
